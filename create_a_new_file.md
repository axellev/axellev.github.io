# Creation of a new file 

I'll create a new file on **VScode**, make a *commit* on **Vim** and push it using **Bash**

## Instructions 

First thing I created a new file and I'll write the instructions for this new file to be seen on Github.com

**Bash commands**

* ls => will show you your folder
* ls create_a_new_file.md &rightarrow; will open your file on cmder
* git status &rightarrow; hows the status of your file
* git log &rightarrow; shows the history
* **q** &rightarrow; to quit the history
* git diff &rightarrow; shows the difference in your file
* git add &rightarrow; adds a file or the files'modifications to the staging area (also called the index)

* git commit &rightarrow; creates a new snapshot of the repository, with the changes added in the previous step. It opens Vim to write a commit message.
* git commit -v &rightarrow; creates a new commit and in Vim shows you the diff.
