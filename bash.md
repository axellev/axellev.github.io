# Bash

I use a bit Bash within cmder, mostly to use Git. Here are some typical commands I use.

- `ls` &rightarrow; list files and directories in the current directory
- `ls <some-directory>` &rightarrow; list files and directories in the given directory
- `cd` &rightarrow; change the current directory, i.e. navigate
