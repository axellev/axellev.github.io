My [personal homepage](https://axelle.dev).

But also some notes:

- [Bash](bash.md)
- [Keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md)
- [Git](git.md)

I can even write some Python code. To do so I enclose it with triple backticks, and I add "python" on the first line to get syntax highlighting:

Trying to add some comments via vim.

```python
def f(a, b):
    pass
```

I have opened and edited this file with VS code like this:

```bash
Î» code README.md
```
